# Eats & Adventures Tracker

Thank you for stopping by my repo for my side project! Here are some quick facts about this project: 

Over my winter break from grad school at the Institute for Advanced Analytics, I developed a hashtag#Streamlit app leveraging data visualizations and NLP to track and analyze my ratings and reviews of coffee shops, restaurants, and locations Iâ€™ve explored since moving to the Triangle in June.

Key Highlights of the App include: 

ðŸŒŸ Personalized Recommendations: A tailored recommendation engine that compares reviewed locations, featuring sentiment analysis and text visualizations of frequently used words in reviews.

ðŸŒŸ Public Feedback Integration: A public review contribution form to mitigate bias and enrich ratings.

ðŸŒŸ Dynamic Dashboards: Advanced filtering options and real-time updates for seamless exploration.
